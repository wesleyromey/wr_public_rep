NOTE: Here, I only include problems I solved from LeetCode
without copying + pasting someone else's solution.

NOTE: Also, LeetCode constructs a Solution class and a
"main" function inside it which it runs all test cases through.
If all test cases pass, then the submission is successful

If my solution is similar to another's solution, it's because
there are many thousands and possibly millions of submissions
for many of these problems
